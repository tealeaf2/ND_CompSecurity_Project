# ND_CompSecurity_Project

Project for the University of Notre Dame for CSE 40567/60567 researching cryptography algorithms, focusing on the techniques and practices.

The algorithms that will be focused on are:
* Vinegere Cipher
* Triple DES
* The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* RSA 

We developed an interactive graphical user interaface (GUI) that allows selection for any algorithm for encryption/decryption, key inputs of various types (binaries, hashes, etc...), and an visual explanation of the process as it encrypts/decypts.
